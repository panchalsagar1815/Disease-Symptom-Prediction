# Disease-Symptom-Prediction


The "Disease Symptom Prediction" project is a focused initiative designed to leverage machine learning for predicting potential health conditions based on a set of symptoms. This project incorporates an array of symptoms, including abdominal pain, abnormal menstruation, acidity, acute liver failure, altered sensorium, anxiety, back pain, belly pain, blackheads, watering from eyes, weakness in limbs, weakness of one body side, weight gain, weight loss, yellow crust ooze, yellow urine, yellowing of eyes, yellowish skin, and itching.

Utilizing advanced algorithms and data analytics, the project aims to identify patterns and correlations within the symptom data to predict likely diseases or health issues. The predictive model considers the interplay of various symptoms to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and timely intervention.

The "Disease Symptom Prediction" project holds the potential to provide valuable insights for medical practitioners, enabling them to make more informed decisions in patient care. By enhancing the efficiency of the diagnostic process, this project contributes to improved healthcare outcomes and facilitates proactive measures for individuals exhibiting specific symptoms.
